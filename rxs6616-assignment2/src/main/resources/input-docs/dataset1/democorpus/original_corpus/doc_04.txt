As per ICC regulations, ten Test playing nations will qualify automatically for the 2015 tournament. Four associate or affiliate member nations will participate in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. Immediately after the 2011 edition of the tournament it was decided that the next World Cup would be reduced to 10 teams, allowing only the ICC's 10 full members to participate. This was met with heavy criticism from a number of associate nations, especially from the Ireland cricket team, who had performed well in 2007 and 2011. The ICC Cricket Committee voted in May 2011 to support the calls for a qualification process. During the annual conference in Hong Kong in June 2011, the ICC decided that 14 teams will participate in the 2015 World Cup, opening up four qualifying places.
