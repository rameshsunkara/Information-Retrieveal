Powerplay and fielding restrictions .. 

There will be only two blocks of Powerplays overs, instead of three. For uninterrupted innings, the first block will be during the first ten overs and only two fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle. The second block, comprising five overs, will be taken by the batting side and must be completed by the 40th over. Only three fielders will be allowed outside the circle during the second Powerplay. During non-Powerplay overs, a maximum of four fielders can be placed outside the circle, a reduction from the earlier five.
