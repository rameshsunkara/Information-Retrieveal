The ICC originally announced the previous edition, the 2011 Cricket World Cup hosts on 30 April 2006. Australian and New Zealand and also bid for the tournament and a successful Australasian bid for the 2011 World Cup would have seen a 50–50 split in games, with the final still up for negotiation. The Trans-Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only bid for 2011 delivered to the ICC headquarters at Dubai before 1 March deadline. Considerable merits of the bid included the superior venues and infrastructure, and the total support of the Australian and New Zealand governments on tax and custom issues during the tournament, according to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland. The New Zealand government had also assured that the Zimbabwean cricket team will be allowed to take part in the tournament after political discussions about whether their team would be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005.
