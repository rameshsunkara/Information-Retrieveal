If the bowler throws, rather than bowls, the ball is a no. If the bowler breaks the non-striker's wicket during the act of delivery (Law from 1 Oct 2013 and ICC playing regulation from 30th April 2013), we have a no ball. The new regulation is included in Test Match Regulations for Summer 2013 in England [8]The changes that modify Law 24 are recent additions, intended to resolve the controversy caused during the 2012 South Africa tour of England by Steve Finn's regular breaking of the bowler's wicket, and South Africa's objection to it on the grounds of distraction to the batsman. The Laws provide for the Umpire to judge and call Dead ball in such a case of distraction, and still do, but leave open the problem that such a dead ball may also turn out to have played in favour of the bowling team. The change remains controversial in the sense that the original problem only occurred during a single Test series, with a single bowler, and predominantly a single batsman claiming distraction.
