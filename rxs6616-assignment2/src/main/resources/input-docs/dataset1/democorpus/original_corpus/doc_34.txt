A No ball may be called for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, it is the result of a bowler breaking one of the first two rules below (a front foot No ball or back foot No ball). Dangerous deliveries (beamers) are another common reason. If the front foot of a bowler lands inside the crease and slides outside of the crease, then it is not a No ball. However, if the foot lands outside the crease, it is a No ball.
