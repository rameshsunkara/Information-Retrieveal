Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. dhawan stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. dhawan is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.
