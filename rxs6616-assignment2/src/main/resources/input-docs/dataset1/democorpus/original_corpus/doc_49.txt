The 2015 tournament will feature 14 teams, the same number as the 2011 icc cricket World Cup, giving associate and affiliate member nations a chance to participate. The format is the same as the 2011 edition. Fourteen teams would take part in the initial stages, divided into two groups of 7. The 7 teams play each other once before the top 4 teams from each group qualifies for the quarter-finals. The format ensures that a team gets to play a minimum of 6 matches even if they exit in the group stage. Australia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup which was played in a round-robin format and was won by Pakistan.
