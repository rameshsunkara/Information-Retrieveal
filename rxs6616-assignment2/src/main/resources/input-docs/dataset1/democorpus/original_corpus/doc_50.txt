If the bowler bowls without some part of the front foot either grounded or in the air behind the popping crease, then it is a no ball. If the bowler bowls with the back foot not wholly inside the return crease, then it is a no ball. Other reasons for a no ball are If the ball does not touch the ground in its flight between the wickets and reaches the batsman on the full (this delivery is called a Beamer) at a height above either his waist, when delivered by a fast bowler, or the shoulder when delivered by a slow bowler. The judgement of height is for the batsman standing upright at the popping crease. ICC International Match Playing Regulations.
