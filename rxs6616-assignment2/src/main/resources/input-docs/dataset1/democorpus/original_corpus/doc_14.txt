Salman Khan can change your life for the better if he takes you under his gracious wings. Don’t believe us? Look at the likes of Himesh Reshammiya and many more Bollywood aspirants and you will be convinced of bhai’s big role in making stars out of ambitious souls. The biggest beneficiary of Sallu’s close friendship, of course, is none other than Katrina Kaif. The Dhoom:3 star doesn’t shy away from accepting the massive role Salman has played in her life, in getting her to the place where she has reached today. There’s no denying the fact that Kat wouldn’t have been the diva that she is had she not put in the hard work she has to make it big in Bollywood. But Salman Khan’s instrumental role in the babe’s life will always eclipse Kaif’s graceful personality and her tremendous determination to excel.
