Garnet Gemstone - Stone for Career Studies and Success and Love

Garnet is a semiprecious gem stone species which come in a wide variety of colors and types just like Tourmaline. This stone is the modern, traditional and ayurvedic birthstone for those born in the month of January. It is the talismanic stone for the Zodiac Sign of Taurus and Planetary stone for Scorpio. Garnet is also the wedding anniversary gemstone associated with the 2nd and 6th years of marriage and the base Chakra. The name of this gem stone is derived from the Latin word "granatum" which means pomegranate because of its resemblance in color with Pomegranate seeds. Although Garnet is normally seen in the color of pomegranate seeds, it is also seen in a multitude of other colors including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, black, pink, brown, purple or colorless because of the unique combinations of elements such as iron, calcium and manganese in the gem. Most of the varieties of Garnets are named based on their color.
