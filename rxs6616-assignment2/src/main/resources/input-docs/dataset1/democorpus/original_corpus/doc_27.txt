The actor was asked why he had not brought his daughter along and replied she was both too young and was, in fact, with her mother, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, in Dubai. Bachchan spoke to the press in the Indian capital of New Delhi, where he was the star guest for designer Ritu Beri's fourth annual Children's Fashion Collection, an event organised to raise funds for underprivileged children and increase awareness of autism.
