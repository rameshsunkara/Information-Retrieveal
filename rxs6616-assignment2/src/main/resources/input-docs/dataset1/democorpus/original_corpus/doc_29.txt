It is said that Palmistry has migrated from India to other countries like Greece, Egypt, Persia and Syria in ancient times. Samudra, deity of the Seas has first given this knowledge to the world, hence this is called 'Samudrika'. Sages like Narada, Valmiki, Garga, Bhrigu, Prahlada and Astrologers like Varahamihira have done a lot of work in Palmistry. Palmistry was discussed in the great books like 'Bhavishya Puranam' and 'Hasta Sanjeevani'. But some how Palmistry could not receive proper attention in India in modern times. It is given high regard in Western countries.
