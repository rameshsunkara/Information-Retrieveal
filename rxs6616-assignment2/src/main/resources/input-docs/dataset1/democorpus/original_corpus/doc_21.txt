Palmistry or chiromancy (also spelled cheiromancy, Greek kheir, hand ; manteia, divination), is the art of characterization and foretelling the future through the study of the palm, also known as palm reading, or chirology. The practice of palmistry is found all over the world, with numerous cultural variations. Those who practice palmistry are generally called palmists, palm readers, hand readers, hand analysts, or chirologists. The information outlined below is briefly representative of modern palmistry; there are many interpretations of various lines and palmar features across various schools of palmistry. These contradictions between different interpretations, as well as the lack of empirical support for palmistry's predictions, contribute to perception of palmistry as a pseudoscience among academics.
