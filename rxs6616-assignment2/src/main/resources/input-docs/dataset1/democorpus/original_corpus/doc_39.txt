Dressed in pink top and blue denims, Aaradhya Bachchan, grand daughter of Amitabh Bachchan flashed a smile at the paparazzi at the Mumbai airport. Back from a holiday in Europe with parents Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, Aaradhya curiously looked around the camera persons who were busy clicking her and her parents. Looks like the little one is getting used to the flashing cameras finally which keep following her and her mother everywhere.
