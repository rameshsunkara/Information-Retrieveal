Abhishek Bachchan had a lot of fun coming here. I am a film actor and these children (who walked the catwalk) are much better than me. Talking of my daughter, I think it is completely her choice, let her decide her career as and when she wants to. But, Abhishek Bachchan is sure she will be happy to lend her support to such (charitable) causes when she grows up," Bachchan explained. As a parent it is not about material goods. The gifts a parent can give the children are love, care, education and understanding. These are the most important gifts any parent can give. As far as I am concerned, taking care of the child is never just a mother's role. It's all about sharing responsibilities," he continued.
