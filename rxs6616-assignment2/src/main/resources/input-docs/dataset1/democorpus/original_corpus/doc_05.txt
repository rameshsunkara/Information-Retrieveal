In an uninterrupted match, the first 10 overs of an innings will be a mandatory powerplay. No team or captain can change the occurrence of this powerplay. The other powerplay is a block of five overs: which will be at the discretion of either of the batsmen at the wicket. It is often referred to as the batting powerplay. During the mandatory powerplay only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle and there must be a minimum of two stationary fielders within the applicable fielding restriction area measured from the striker’s end at the instant of delivery. During batting powerplay overs in an odi, only three fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. During the non-powerplay overs, no more than four fielders shall be permitted outside the fielding restriction area.
