Palmistry consists of the practice of evaluating a person's character or future life by reading the palm of that person's hand. Various lines (heart line, life line, etc.) and mounts (or bumps) (chirognomy), purportedly suggest interpretations by their relative sizes, qualities, and intersections. In some traditions, palmistry enthusiasts also examine characteristics of the fingers, fingernails, fingerprints and palmar skin patterns (dermatoglyphics), skin texture and color, shape of the palm, and flexibility of the hand.
