New ODI Rules : 
Powerplay rule change : Since the inception of the Powerplay rule as explained in Powerplay Rule in Cricket, it has been an added headache for teams and captains. There were 3 power-plays earlier; first between over number 1 and 10. It was termed as mandatory power-play. Then there were P1 and P2 each of 5 overs. Batting and fielding teams had option to choose when to take assigned power-plays after mandatory power-play was over. Now according to new rule, mandatory power-play (between first 10 overs) will remain as it is. After this power-play, there will be only one power-play of 5 overs, which should be completed before 40th over of innings and that can be called by batting side.
