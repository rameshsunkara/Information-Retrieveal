Rosetta Stone programs both online and installed cost a lot, with Level I in most languages coming in at over $200. Buying multiple levels will get you a discount, but this price still packs a big punch for success. And while the program provides you with a worthwhile immersion experience, it isn't instant. You get the most success out of Rosetta Stone when you put in the time required to absorb, a bit at a time, the nuances of a new language.
