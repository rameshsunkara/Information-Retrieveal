Daily Horoscope: Libra

Spiritual passion is tempered by romantic desire today, Libra, and you're likely to want to pursue both. Perhaps your romantic partner is as spiritually inclined as you, and you both aspire to the same ends. Much of the passion you feel wells up from deep within. If you're in any way creatively inclined, you may want to memorialize these feelings through writing, painting, or music.
