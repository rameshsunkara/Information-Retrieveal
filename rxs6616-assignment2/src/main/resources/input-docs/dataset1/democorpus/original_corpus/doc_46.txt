SUCCESS Legend: W. Clement Stone
Mr. Positive Mental Attitude
When William Clement Stone was just 3, his father died, leaving nothing but gambling debts and a widow and son in poverty.

Living with his mother and relatives in an apartment on Chicago’s rough South Side, 6-year-old Stone sold newspapers to help support the family. In this hardscrabble environment of the early 1900s, he had to compete with older boys for street-corner territory. But the young Stone was adaptable and resourceful. He began concentrating on restaurants as better places to peddle papers.

Even the Great Depression couldn’t diminish spirit od Stone. By 1930, he had 1,000 insurance agents in his employ selling life and accident insurance. He often hired people with little or no studies or prospects, and was likely the catalyst for many a Horatio Alger success story.
